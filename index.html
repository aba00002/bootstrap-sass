        </h3>
        <p class="sql">
          SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database.

It is mostly used by all websites for the purpose of validation. In addition to validations, it supports external applications like PDF documents, running widgets, supporting for flash applications etc. It can also load content into a document whenever the user requires it without even reloading the entire page. JavaScript is also used in web development, games development, smart-watch applications development, mobile applications development and in building flying robots.

          CSS <span class='iconCss'></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="css">
            CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.

          GitHub, can be divided into the Git, and the Hub. The service includes access controls as well as a number of collaboration features like tools for basic task management and for all projects you handle. GitHub hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. So, the “Git” implies the version control system; a tool which allows developers to keep track of the constant revisions to their code. The “Hub” is the community of like-minded individuals who participate. It is all about the collaborative effort of the community, in reviewing, improving, and deriving new ideas from the uploaded code. It’s definitely something worth looking into!
